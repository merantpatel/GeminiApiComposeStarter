## Verification results

Verified on 23 September 2026 with the Pixel_7 emulator, Android 15/API 35, and Gradle 9.3.1.

- **BUILD SUCCESSFUL** for debug APK, instrumentation APK, R8-minified release APK, unit tests and Android lint after the final system-bar theme fix.
- **12/12 ViewModel unit tests passed**, zero failures/errors/skips.
- **14/14 instrumentation tests passed**, zero failures/errors/skips: seven Compose tests, two voice-intent integration tests, two secure-storage/preference tests, one Room persistence test, one application-context test and one real Gemini test.
- After the final system-bar fix, only the affected live/theme screenshot test was repeated against the rebuilt APK: **OK (1 test)**. Existing unrelated test results were retained.
- The Google endpoint returned **modelVersion: gemini-3.6-flash**. The app also received and persisted real responses through its Keystore-backed repository. There is no model override/fallback.
- The real app launched, displayed bubbles and loading progress, retained conversation and dark theme after force-stop/relaunch, displayed empty-input validation, and adapted to landscape and a 1920 x 1200 / 240 dpi tablet-width configuration. Emulator display settings were restored.
- The real clear-history confirmation removed the test conversation; another force-stop/relaunch confirmed it remained cleared.
- Network/repository failures, storage failures, missing-key handling and duplicate-send protection were verified through deterministic unit/UI tests. An actual offline network transition was not separately exercised.
- Screenshots under screenshots/ are actual emulator captures, not mockups. The conversation content came from the real Gemini API. Loading capture asserts the indicator is displayed before capture; settled theme screenshots include system bars.
- Lint passed with no errors. Remaining warnings concern available dependency/target-SDK updates and unused starter resources; no warning baseline or suppression was added.
- The secret audit checked actual configured-key bytes, common Google API-key patterns, tracked/untracked nonignored files, index/diffs and all reachable Git commits/blobs. local.properties is ignored and not staged. No real key was displayed or committed.

## Verification limits

- RecognizerIntent launch, successful text delivery and cancellation passed with Espresso intent results. Physical microphone/acoustic transcription needs one spoken phrase on a speech-enabled device; no claim of that manual test is made.
- Android Studio was located and launched, but exposed no usable window to automation. Layout Inspector recomposition counts were therefore not measured. The implementation uses lazy items with stable keys/content types and background I/O, and README records the remaining inspector procedure.
- The entire DOCX text, including header/footer/note parts, was extracted and read. The bundled DOCX renderer could not run because bundled LibreOffice was unavailable; no assignment document was modified.
- Teams is explicitly deferred. No Turn In, Submit, attachment or comment action was performed.
